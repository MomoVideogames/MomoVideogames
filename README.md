- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MomoVideogames
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development in Unity
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity. From 2011 to 2018 I worked as a front-end game developer in Unity in several game companies. I have been 4 years without coding a game at all and I want to get back my skills.
- I want to do a small game and a set of tools. My idea is to share the code to get other users' opinions. Furthermore, if the code can be useful for someone else, you are welcome to use it.
